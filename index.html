                            <p>Drawn from a combination of experience working in the Swiss private banking sector and born out of the research and development environment at the University of Exeter, our software was created, and a beta version moved into testing.</p>

                            <p>Corona Virus lockdown; driving change, the uptake in new technologies and ways of working, doing business and communicating.

                            <p>With the dust barely settled from Covid-19, the markets are gripped by an ongoing conflict in Ukraine, an energy crisis, increased inflation and global turbulence. Aptius' success in navigating that change and using the growth found in 2020/21 to scale holdings to see its client base expand considerably. The AI revolution and expanding our team metamorphosize our approach. Diversification coupled with expansion became central to our vision, and we opt for a blend of traditional and unconventional commercial investment.</p>
